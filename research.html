            <h2>The Hodge Research Group & Power System Security Assessment</h2>
            <p>Our work is deeply aligned with the cutting-edge research conducted by Professor Bri-Mathias Hodge's group at CU Boulder and NREL. A key focus of their work, led by PhD student Muhy Eddin Za'ter, is accelerating Power System Security Assessment (PSSA) using advanced AI, specifically **Multi-Task Learning (MTL)** frameworks.</p>

            <h2>The Perfect Complement: Classification vs. Regression</h2>
            <p>Analysis of their research reveals a powerful synergy. Their work and our GridOS project solve two different, but equally critical, sequential questions an operator faces after a grid fault:</p>

                    <h3>Hodge Group's Research (Classification)</h3>
                    <p>Their MTL framework answers the first question: **"After the fault, will the system remain stable?"** It classifies the post-contingency state into one of several stability categories (e.g., stable, voltage unstable, transiently unstable).</p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>GridOS GNN (Regression)</h3>
                    <p>Our GNN answers the essential follow-up question: **"Given the system *is* stable, where are the new high-stress points and what is the exact loading on every line?"** It provides a high-resolution, quantitative prediction.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="conclusion-text">This positions GridOS as the perfect "next step" in a complete security assessment workflow, providing the specific, actionable detail needed for an operator to take corrective action.</p>

            <h2>A Unified Vision for Grid Intelligence</h2>
            <p>This alignment demonstrates that GridOS is not just a clever engineering solution, but the commercial vanguard of a new, academically validated paradigm in power systems managementâ€”moving beyond siloed analysis to integrated, multi-faceted predictive intelligence.</p>
